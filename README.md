Get coordinate boundaries of a chunk by providing any x, z coordinates inside of that chunk in **Minecraft**.

## Usage

This application was written in the **[AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)<sup>[1](#note1)</sup>** scripting language &amp; can be run in 2 ways:

1. The provided '.ahk' file is an **AutoHotkey** script &amp; can be executed with the AutoHotkey.exe program which can be installed locally or as a portable program.

    - If **AutoHotkey** is installed or .ahk files are associated with the portable executable then you should be able to just run the .ahk file like any other executable.

    - If **AutoHotkey** is portable and .ahk files are not associated with .ahk files then you have to run the .ahk file by passing the .ahk file to the AutoHotkey.exe as a parameter.

1. There are 2 stand alone compiled exectuables in the 'compiled' directory which do not need **AutoHotkey** to be installed.

    - You can compile this yourself with AHK's - Ahk2Exe.exe provided with the program.
